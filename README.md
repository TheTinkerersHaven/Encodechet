# :sparkles: Encodechet :sparkles:	

Encodechet is a fun, lightweight, and entirely **useless** encoder/decoder for text files that uses the custom `.edch` format. It's perfect for anyone looking to experiment with a quirky encoding system or to confuse their friends with unreadable file formats!

## Features

- Encode text files into the custom `.edch` format.
- Decode `.edch` files back into readable text.
- Completely useless but oddly satisfying to use.

## Why Use Encodechet?

This project exists purely for fun and experimentation. If you're curious about creating custom file formats or encoding mechanisms, Encodechet is a great example to explore!

## Prerequisites

- If you use the compiled .exe file, a Windows installation.
- If you use the .py files, Python 3.10+ (because of the match/case, you can replace it with an if/else to use Python 3.6+)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheTinkerersHaven/Encodechet.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Encodechet
   ```

## Usage

### Encoding a Text File
Open the program, input the text file's path, and choose "encode".

### Decoding a `.edch` File
Open the program, input the dechetCode file's path, and choose "encode".

## Example

Input text file (`input.txt`):
```
Hello, Encodechet!
```

Encoded file (`output.edch`):
```
