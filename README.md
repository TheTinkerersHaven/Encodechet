# :sparkles: Encodechet :sparkles:	

Encodechet is a fun, lightweight (yes yes i know Python is slow, shut up), and entirely **useless** encoder/decoder for text files that uses the custom `.edch` format. It's perfect for anyone looking to experiment with a quirky encoding system or to confuse their friends with unreadable file formats!

## Features

- Encode text files into the custom `.edch` format;
- Decode `.edch` files back into readable text;
- Completely useless but oddly satisfying to use;
- Confuse your friends (or enemies) by sending them a totally garbage unreadable file;
- Get laughed at every time you open an encoded .edch file.

## Why Use Encodechet?

This project exists purely for fun and experimentation. If you're curious about creating custom file formats or encoding mechanisms, Encodechet is a great example to explore!

## Why the name Encodechet?

It's a portmanteau of the words "Encode" and "DÃ©chet" (French for "garbage"). It sums up the project pretty well and sounds sick (hell yeah).

## Prerequisites

- If you use the compiled .exe file (coming soon), a Windows installation.
- If you use the .py files, Python 3.10+ (because of the match/case, you can replace it with an if/else to use Python 3.6+)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheTinkerersHaven/Encodechet.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Encodechet
   ```

## Usage

### Encoding a Text File
Open the program, input the text file's path, and choose "encode" (follow the on-screen prompt).

### Decoding a `.edch` File
Open the program, input the dechetCode file's path, and choose "decode" (follow the on-screen prompt).

## Example

Input text file (`hello.txt`):
```
Hello, Encodechet!
```

Encoded file (`hello.edch`):
```
